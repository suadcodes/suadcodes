Hi, my name is Suad Ali Hersi. Currently I'm doing many things amongst which is pursuing a Master's of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Queen Mary University of London.

My strongest skill is being a really good problem solver.
A fun fact about me is that I'm a polygot. I speak Somali, Swahili and English Fluently and speak Intermediate Arabic.
